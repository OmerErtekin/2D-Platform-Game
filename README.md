Hi there! That's the scripts for my Unity2D Platform Game which is including many Player and Enemy algorithms like move/attack/crouch/jump/range attack and more. Also you can 
find many scripts for interactive objects like chest or game buffs. For the visual part of the game, unfortunately i can't upload whole game because of my internet but 
(i hope) shortly there will be a link in this file for download my game to your android devices so until that time i will use this repository as a backup system.You can
feel free yourself to fork or take those algorithms.
